<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Onyeka Norbert Okoye and i am a 200L of Alex Ekwueme University, 
  Funai and i study Accounting. Tho it has not been easy with going to classes and fending for yourself but i try my
   possible best to come out with a good grade. </p>

<p>I started learning how to code when i was 18 years old but i have not been constant with it cause i have to work to be able
  to provide for what i will eat tomorrow. The journey has'nt been easy tho but i am trying to work enough money so i
   can concentrate on learning my programming then i won't have to work those hard jobs i do just to survive. i do some other
    minor jobs like Trading and fixing of wallpapers which is known as house decorations</p>

<p>My Journey throw codinh has been great and i enjoy every session learned from my Mentor Angela Yu, Thank
   you so much for this course and i hope to meet you one day so we could get to code and maybe go get Icecreamüç® haha</p>
